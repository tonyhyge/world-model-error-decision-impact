"""Fork MDP: a two-branch choice point with a controllable action gap.

The agent commits to a branch at the root and then walks it; branches differ in
success probability and terminal reward, so the root action margin can be set
by construction. This gives a family of small exact MDPs in which a matched
pair of opposite-direction perturbations can be built and solved exactly.
